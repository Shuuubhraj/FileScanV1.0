FileScan - VirusTotal API Key Setup and Usage Guide
---------------------------------------------------

Thank you for using FileScan, a tool designed to help you scan files for malware using the VirusTotal API. To get started, please follow the steps below to obtain your VirusTotal API key and set up FileScan.

Step 1: Obtain Your VirusTotal API Key
--------------------------------------

1. Go to the VirusTotal website: https://www.virustotal.com/
2. If you have an account, log in. If not, you'll need to create an account.
3. After logging in, navigate to your profile settings.
4. Find the API key section and generate a new API key.
5. Copy the generated API key to your clipboard.

Step 2: Save Your API Key
--------------------------

1. Open a text editor such as Notepad on Windows.
2. Paste the API key into the document.
3. Save the document with the filename "YOUR_API_KEY.txt" (without the quotes) in the same directory as the FileScan script.
4. Do not share your API key with anyone! It's a sensitive credential that should be kept private.

Important Notes and Tips
-------------------------

- Your VirusTotal API key is required for FileScan to communicate with the VirusTotal service and perform scans.
- Do not delete or share your "YOUR_API_KEY.txt" file. It contains your API key.
- Each VirusTotal user has a daily usage limit for API requests. Free users typically have a limit of [4] requests per minute and [5760] requests per day.
- If you reach your daily limit, you'll need to wait until the next day for your API usage to reset.
